<h1>Angular Sample Application</h1>

<p>A single-page application (SPA) I am currently building with Angular using TypeScript. This sample application demonstrates key Angular concepts, such as the Angular Module (NgModule), app modules, components, importing modules, exporting your created modules, using decorators, inline templates, data binding techniques (property binding, event binding, two-way binding), adding logic to the template, transforming data with pipes and custom pipes, how to use a TypeScript Interface, and much more!</p>
